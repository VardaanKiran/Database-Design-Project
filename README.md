# Database-Design-Project
This is my database design project which I conducted in semester 2 of my 2nd year. Basically we were given to design a database for anything we could think of. Therefore I designed a database for an online retail shop. I used java and connected it to MySQL using a JDBC Driver where I was able to create and perform queries in the intellij IDE. I also made a small GUI in Netbeans to interact with the MySQL database. Therefore, whenever I ran any queries either from the GUI or from the intellij IDE I was able to see the changes in my database without any persisting issues. Overall I achieved 100% in this project since I've met all the necessary requirements.
